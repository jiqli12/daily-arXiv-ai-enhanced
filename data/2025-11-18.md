### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析框架来研究AI能力是否会无限增长，通过物理和信息理论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型来区分超线性和亚临界状态，并提供可测试的决策规则和安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量条件下会出现能力无限增长，以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可测试条件替代推测。

Method: 开发递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，基于功率、带宽和内存的物理限制定义服务边界，建立资本与计算、数据和能源耦合的内生增长模型。

Result: 推导出将可观测序列映射为失控与正常行为证书的决策规则，提供基于功率限制、吞吐量节流和评估门等可实施的安全控制措施。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试条件和可部署控制取代了对AI奇点的推测，能够认证或排除AI奇点的发生。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展且高效的数据归因方法，通过将基于反学习的慢速归因方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，实现高效检索对生成输出影响最大的训练图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型数据归因方法计算资源消耗大，每次查询都需要大量计算，难以在实际应用中推广。

Method: 将慢速的基于反学习的归因方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索方法，无需运行昂贵的归因算法即可找到高影响力训练图像。

Result: 在MSCOCO训练的中等规模模型和LAION训练的大规模Stable Diffusion模型上均取得优异表现，比现有方法快2,500-400,000倍，仅需几秒钟即可完成归因。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现数据归因方法在Stable Diffusion等真实世界模型上的大规模应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线陡峭和并发症影响质量的问题，需要数据驱动的工具来减少变异性、优化培训和改善手术表现。

Method: 通过Delphi流程达成工作流程描述符的共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并由独立评估者在多中心视频数据集上应用该工具，评估适用性和评估者间可靠性。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评估者间可靠性中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow是首个基于共识的验证VBA工具，为视频性能评估建立了可重复框架，支持机构间基准比较和AI驱动的工作流程识别发展。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Method: 使用可解释AI技术LRP进行模型剪枝，针对少量数据场景优化剪枝策略。

Result: 提出的方法在保持精度方面优于现有方法，实现了更高的剪枝率。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算资源受限环境下的模型压缩提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法在概率性降雨临近预报任务中表现出色，计算效率高且性能优于传统3D-UNET方法，为短期降雨预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting. A video projector (V-JEPA Vision Transformer) associated to a lightweight probabilistic head is attached to a pre-trained satellite vision encoder (DINOv3\text{-}SAT493M) to map encoder tokens into a discrete empirical CDF (eCDF) over 4-hour accumulated rainfall. The projector-head is optimized end-to-end over the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). As an alternative, 3D-UNET baselines trained with an aggregate Rank Probability Score and a per-pixel Gamma-Hurdle objective are used. On the Weather4Cast 2025 benchmark, the proposed method achieved a promising performance, with a CRPS of 3.5102 (CRPS), which represents $\approx$26\% in effectiveness gain against the best 3D-UNET.

### [8] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一种新颖的相位窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的忠实区域归因，通过分阶段的粗到细搜索实现了近线性复杂度，显著减少了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子模子集选择的方法虽然忠实度高，但计算效率低，限制了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段的粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪婪选择。

Result: PhaseWin仅使用20%的计算预算就实现了贪婪归因95%以上的忠实度，在对象检测和视觉定位任务中持续优于其他归因基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [9] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在OOD检测中使用负提示时，由于包含过于广泛的非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用LLM初始化类别特定的正负提示，然后优化这些提示——正提示关注类内特征，负提示关注类别边界特征，并通过图架构将语义监督传播到视觉分支。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K两个基准测试上，针对8个OOD数据集和5种不同LLM的广泛实验表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递，有效提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n两种轻量级模型在面部表情识别任务中的性能，发现在干净数据集上YOLOv12n表现更优，而在噪声环境中YOLOv11n具有更高的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非约束的真实世界环境中，面部表情识别仍然具有挑战性，需要平衡性能与效率的轻量级模型。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型在统一检测和分类框架下进行评估。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净的KDEF数据集上获得95.6的mAP 0.5最高性能，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精度为65.2，假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡性能与效率，在敏感性和精度间存在权衡，适合实时、资源受限的情感感知AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [11] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD)框架，通过整合教师和学生的互补特征来对齐共享logits表示，解决异构架构知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏（如ViT到ResNet18）面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统同构KD方法难以有效解决，现有异构KD方法计算成本高、设计复杂或过度依赖logit对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: 提出HCD框架：1）通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征，与教师倒数第二层特征拼接后通过CFM模块映射生成共享logits；2）引入子logit解耦蒸馏（SDD），将共享logits划分为n个子logits并与教师logits融合；3）提出正交性损失（OL）确保子logit多样性并减少冗余知识传递。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的大量实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提升了分割性能

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM是一种用于微表情识别的多模态大语言模型，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐，解决了静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情绪至关重要。现有方法面临两个核心挑战：静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠导致模型难以关注细微运动；现有MER数据集中的文本标签与底层面部肌肉运动不完全对应，存在语义差距。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐。首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应性。然后设计包含三个专家的架构，将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的MER基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特殊优势。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过整合Uni-MER的指令对齐知识，为微表情注入有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，能够精确捕捉细微情绪线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准（如COCO、Flickr30K）上达到最先进准确率，同时自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布。3D MRI变体（ERMoE-ba）将脑年龄预测准确率提高超过7%，并产生解剖学上可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了一种新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定问题，并通过可扩展、可解释的专业化实现改进的性能，无需显式平衡损失。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP模型类增量学习的两阶段框架，通过解耦视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化来解决分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT是其增强版本，引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在持续学习新类别时存在分类器偏差问题，文本原型容易过拟合到新类别，且现有方法忽略了视觉编码器更新时产生的分布漂移问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段冻结文本提示优化视觉编码器，第二阶段冻结视觉编码器优化文本软提示。DMC-OT额外引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息，并采用任务特定提示设计增强任务间可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都达到了最先进的性能，DMC-OT进一步将准确率平均提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的优化有效解决了CLIP模型在类增量学习中的挑战，DMC-OT通过最优传输校准进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过多相位聚合平滑时间核，解决视频LLMs中因RoPE扩展导致的时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会导致注意力翻转并抑制相关帧。这源于多模态RoPE扩展引起的时间核波动。

Method: 提出PAS方法：在不同注意力头应用相反的相位偏移，然后聚合输出。该方法保持每头频谱幅度，同时平滑时间核并减少相位敏感性，无需改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在相同token预算下获得一致改进，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLMs提供了即插即用的鲁棒时间编码升级方案。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，用于零样本视觉任务，通过量化和二值化将开放性问题转换为多项选择题和真/假验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过推理时设计而非任务特定训练，提升现成视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中的性能。

Method: 工作流包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放性问题转换为多项选择题；(2) 二值化：对每个候选答案提出真/假问题，通过确定性规则解决。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，量化到多项选择题带来显著提升，真/假二值化进一步提供一致增益。

Conclusion: 该工作流提供了一种简单统一的实用方法，可在不进行额外训练的情况下显著提升现成视觉语言模型的零样本视觉性能。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的生成模型框架，通过固定格式提示实现多样化和稳定的图像生成，无需额外数据，特别适用于医学等数据有限的专门领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在医学等专门领域中，由于数据类型有限和数据量不足，现有文本到图像合成方法难以实现多样化生成同时保持稳定性的问题。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，并将其输入到U-Net的新第二注意力层中，通过Kullback-Leibler散度实现潜在空间中图像特征的连续高斯分布表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的分类器在1000%规模下F1分数达83.21%，合成数据与真实数据结合时F1分数达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样化且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示注意层次对比学习来解决模态缺失问题，在基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态数据常常存在模态缺失问题，导致现有多模态模型性能显著下降，主要原因是完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。

Method: 提出PROMISE框架，将多模态提示学习融入层次对比学习框架，配备专门设计的提示注意机制，动态生成缺失模态场景下的鲁棒一致表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和消融研究明确展示了PROMISE相比当前最先进多模态方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过创新的提示注意层次对比学习机制，有效弥合了完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，为解决模态缺失问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实情境下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，包含情感标签、视觉属性和文本标注；通过系统分析发现情感感知的时空模式；基于Wan2.1模型微调开发情感条件视频生成技术。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频中的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在视觉处理瓶颈，容易失去视觉证据的接地性，在长时间生成过程中缺乏情境化的视觉体验。

Method: 提出VisMem框架，包含短期模块用于细粒度感知保留和长期模块用于抽象语义整合，这些动态潜视觉记忆在推理过程中被无缝调用。

Result: 在多样化的视觉理解、推理和生成基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一个新的潜空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法仅针对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，这限制了安全生成的效果。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词危害性，并应用选择性引导掩码来仅引导图像中的不安全区域，实现了自适应和选择性的安全保护。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最小化了意外内容修改。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中仍存在信息丢失问题，限制了高频细节的恢复。

Method: 利用小波的完美重构特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，作为即插即用解码器块应用于各种U-Net变体。

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，在统一的重构感知框架内实现高频保真度和全局一致性，同时保持计算成本可比。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估基准的空白，揭示了MLLMs在复杂协作场景下的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到最先进结果，仅需单次去噪步骤即可获得82.8%和81.3%的平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点特征融合，有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存（HGC）方法，通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来减少可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提升生成效率同时保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时的计算效率低下问题，这些模型通常需要大量计算资源导致生成效率较低。

Method: 采用两种缓存策略：1）粗粒度缓存（块级）基于特征重用在编码器-解码器块之间动态绕过冗余计算；2）细粒度缓存（提示级）在模块内重用跨注意力图并扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本（MACs）显著降低63%（从18.22T降至6.70T），语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法能够有效平衡生成效率和视觉质量，为可控生成模型提供了高效的计算优化方案。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务转移显示仅使用分类数据训练也能提升分割性能7% cIoU。多模态LLM在组合泛化方面表现独特优势。

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台，多模态大语言模型在组合泛化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Conclusion: 通过多参考图像和特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地同时实现细节保持和前景姿态/视角调整。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

TL;DR: LiteAttention是一种利用扩散注意力时间相干性的方法，通过在去噪序列中跳过进化计算来减少二次注意力复杂度，实现视频扩散模型加速且不损失质量。

Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成中质量优异但存在二次注意力复杂度问题，导致延迟过高。现有加速方法面临动态估计稀疏注意力模式计算开销大、静态稀疏模式固定且次优的权衡问题。

Method: 利用扩散注意力稀疏模式在去噪步骤间具有强时间相干性的特性，提出LiteAttention方法：早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策，消除冗余注意力计算而无需重复分析开销。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生成视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且无质量下降。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，通过利用时间相干性有效解决了扩散变换器的注意力复杂度问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Motivation: 虽然生成模型已在包括3D数据在内的多种数据模态中得到广泛应用，但对于哪种模型最适合特定任务尚未达成共识。此外，文本和图像等条件信息常被用于引导生成过程，而部分3D数据等条件信息尚未得到充分评估。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，为多模态形状补全任务提供了最先进的解决方案；而在离散潜在空间中，自回归模型也能达到相当或更好的性能表现。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Motivation: 解决现有KBVQA方法推理过程不明确的问题，现有方法要么使用MLLMs的隐式知识，要么使用检索增强生成，但缺乏显式的多步推理轨迹。

Method: 1. 提出Hindsight Distilled Reasoning框架，利用冻结的7B大小MLLM构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；2. 自蒸馏为思维链生成器和知识生成器；3. 使用KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好低置信度但有用的知识。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上的实验验证了HinD的有效性，仅使用7B大小MLLM就能达到优越性能，无需商业模型API或外部知识。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，通过显式推理轨迹和知识偏好优化，在KBVQA任务上实现了高效的知识推理。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

TL;DR: OT-ALD是一种基于最优传输理论的图像到图像翻译框架，解决了DDIB方法中存在的翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配问题，通过OT映射改进反向扩散过程，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升翻译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIB方法虽然保持了循环一致性并具有灵活性，但面临翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配导致的翻译轨迹偏差问题。

Method: 提出OT-ALD框架，计算从源域到目标域潜在分布的最优传输映射，将映射后的分布作为目标域反向扩散过程的起点，消除潜在分布不匹配。

Result: 在三个高分辨率数据集的四个翻译任务上，OT-ALD相比最佳基线模型平均提升采样效率20.29%，FID分数降低2.6。

Conclusion: OT-ALD有效平衡了图像翻译速度与质量，通过最优传输理论解决了DDIB方法的局限性，在效率和效果上均有显著提升。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，能够区分不同类型的异常而无需为每个对象类别训练单独模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法通常只能识别异常但无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独模型，这成本高昂。缺乏异常类型特异性是一个重要研究空白，因为识别异常类型对于准确诊断和成本节约决策至关重要。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD为计算资源受限的实际应用提供了一个高度实用和可行的解决方案，特别适用于实时或嵌入式系统。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4D高斯泼溅方法假设输入视频流时序同步，这限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块，首先确定粗粒度的帧级偏移，然后细化到亚帧精度，该模块可作为即插即用组件集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序未对齐视频，显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的时序对齐策略增强了4DGS框架在处理异步数据时的鲁棒性，为未同步多视角视频的高质量重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间模型和视觉定位增强，在保持高效推理的同时解决了多模态模型在细粒度理解上的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小输入变化下的可靠性仍未被充分理解，需要系统评估模型对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用像素级偏移、轻微几何变换、填充重缩放、改写和多语言重写等不改变语义的视觉和文本扰动，在多个模型和数据集上进行大规模系统性测试。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，大部分样本在至少一种视觉或文本修改下会改变预测答案；稳定样本更可能正确回答；小模型稳定性可高精度预测大模型正确性。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在稀疏训练视图下容易过拟合，主要原因是缺乏中间视图的监督。受到视频扩散模型(VDM)成功的启发，作者希望利用VDM中丰富的多视图一致性先验来指导3DGS的优化。

Method: 提出了Guidance Score Distillation (GSD)框架，基于Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)的思想，通过VDM监督多个相邻视图的渲染图像。为了解决VDM生成方向可能包含物体运动和随机相机轨迹的问题，引入了统一的引导形式，包括基于真实深度图的深度扭曲引导和基于语义图像特征的引导。

Conclusion: GSD框架成功利用VDM的多视图一致性先验，有效解决了3DGS在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，并通过深度和语义引导确保了正确的相机姿态和几何精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Method: 通过区分上下文重要性和位置偏见，评估不同模型和数据集中的位置偏见程度，分析其产生原因。

Result: 实验表明位置偏见在多模态模型中普遍存在，文本编码器偏向输入开始位置，图像编码器同时偏向开始和结束位置。偏见源于位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性等多因素组合。

Conclusion: 多模态模型存在明显的位置偏见，且在不同模态中表现不同，这种偏见由多种因素共同导致或放大。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Method: 提出DoReMi框架：1）领域感知专家分支通过领域引导空间路由动态激活，实现上下文感知的专家选择；2）熵控制动态分配确保专家使用的稳定性和效率；3）通过鲁棒多属性自监督学习预训练的冻结统一表示分支，保持跨领域几何和结构先验。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准上评估，DoReMi在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，相比现有方法具有竞争力或更优性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应建模多样化领域分布，同时保持全局一致性。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: GEODE模型通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，解决了现有视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题，使用专用模块实现空间推理和精确回归。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于"平面"感知架构，难以理解真实世界的3D空间智能，存在输入阶段几何感知编码器计算昂贵与2D特征浅层化冲突，以及输出阶段离散标记器无法生成精确连续数值的双重瓶颈。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块(DRM)作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据和2D视觉特征，并将空间链式思维逻辑蒸馏为可注入的推理标记；直接回归头(DRH)采用"嵌入即值"范式，将专用控制标记路由到轻量级MLP进行精确连续回归。

Result: 1.5B参数模型作为高级语义分发器，实现了与7B+模型相媲美的空间推理性能，达到最先进的水平。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双模块架构，有效解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的根本限制，为空间智能提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉语言模型，通过将caption tokens分组来获取细粒度的语言表示，并与图像中对象级别的表示对齐，从而提升模型对视觉和语言的细粒度理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注图像块与语言token的对齐，但图像块对人类视觉没有意义，单个token也不一定携带可接地的图像信息。需要将token分组来描述场景的不同方面，以获得更细粒度的知识理解。

Method: 提出一种模型架构，在模型中自动将caption tokens分组，形成细粒度的语言表示。将这些表示与经过训练用于发现对象的图像编码器输出进行对齐，期望达到图像中对象级别的表示粒度。

Result: 通过学习token分组，视觉语言模型对视觉和语言具有更好的细粒度理解。模型发现的token分组在定性和定量上都与文本中的可接地短语高度相似。

Conclusion: 通过token分组机制，模型能够捕获更细粒度的语言表示，显著提升了视觉语言模型对真实世界的理解能力，且分组的token与可接地短语具有高度相似性。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法准确遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现模型内部已经编码了数值正确性的潜在概念。

Method: 基于模型内部对自身计数准确性的隐含感知，提出CountSteer方法，在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明CountSteer将对象计数准确率提高了约4%，同时保持了视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer展示了通过利用模型内部信号实现更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

*Pavel Rojtberg,Julius Kühn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD是一个标准分辨率的事件相机合成数据集，用于6DoF物体姿态估计，包含50,000个事件序列，基于YCB-Video对象的PBR场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件视觉领域缺乏与帧基计算机视觉相当的全面合成数据资源的问题。

Method: 采用基于物理渲染(PBR)场景和模拟线性相机运动来生成事件序列，遵循BOP方法学，并系统评估不同事件表示方法。

Result: 发现具有线性衰减和双通道极性编码的时间表面在姿态估计性能上表现最佳，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案。

Conclusion: 极性信息对性能提升贡献最大，线性时间编码比指数衰减更有效地保留关键运动信息，数据集以结构化格式提供以促进研究使用。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜空间，结合3D无监督正则化目标，实现与全3D监督方法相当甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但泛化能力有限，这源于精确3D监督使模型过度拟合固定坐标模式，而非学习必要的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜空间，并引入视图一致性、方向一致性和物理合理性等3D无监督正则化目标。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练，Free3D能生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过全3D监督方法。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的新范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合隐马尔可夫随机场(HMRF)理论和CNN分割的方法，实现了无监督学习和快速分割，在PU泡沫结构的μCT图像数据集上展示了高分割精度，并提出了减少标注数据需求的预训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从图像中提取数字材料表示是定量分析材料特性的必要前提。传统分割方法在准确性和速度方面存在不足，监督学习方法需要大量标注数据，而无监督方法分割时间长且精度较差。

Method: 提出HMRF-UNet方法，将HMRF理论与CNN分割相结合，利用邻域和类别分布概念，研究不同邻域项和组件对无监督HMRF损失的贡献。

Result: 在PU泡沫结构的μCT图像数据集上实现了无需真实标注的高分割精度，提出的预训练策略显著减少了训练分割模型所需的标注数据量。

Conclusion: HMRF-UNet方法成功结合了无监督学习和快速分割的优势，在材料图像分割任务中表现出色，预训练策略为减少标注数据需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出LSEF框架，基于低秩稀疏原理解决视频情感计算中的模型不稳定和表示退化问题，通过分层建模情感基和瞬时波动来增强鲁棒性和动态判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临复杂情感动态导致的模型不稳定和表示退化问题，核心限制是缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基和瞬时波动）。

Method: 提出LSEF框架，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性整合模块重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，采用秩感知优化策略平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态判别能力，验证了分层低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态方面的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 分层低秩稀疏建模是理解情感动态的有效方法，LSEF框架通过解耦情感基和瞬时波动，显著提升了视频情感计算的性能。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroVQA++是一个三阶段构建的大规模高质量显微镜视觉问答数据集，通过专家验证、异构图过滤和MLLM生成结合人工筛选的方式，显著提升了显微镜科学推理的数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在生物医学成像中的应用受到大规模高质量训练数据稀缺的限制，特别是显微镜领域的科学推理能力不足。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：第一阶段从专家验证的图-标题对中引导监督；第二阶段使用HiCQA-Graph异构图融合NLI文本蕴含、CLIP视觉语言对齐和智能体信号来过滤不一致样本；第三阶段使用MLLM生成多选题并人工筛选。

Result: 构建的数据集包含大规模训练集和人工检查测试集，其Bloom认知水平难度样本分布超过MicroVQA基准，4B规模的MLLM能达到与GPT-5相当的竞争性性能，并在开源MLLM中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 精心构建的数据集能够显著提升MLLM在显微镜推理任务上的性能，证明了高质量数据构建的重要性，并为生物医学成像领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Doc是一个三层次评估框架，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估中的能力，包括粗粒度评分、中粒度失真类型识别和细粒度失真严重程度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要建立系统评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：1）粗粒度：让MLLMs为文档图像分配质量分数；2）中粒度：设计失真类型识别任务；3）细粒度：引入失真严重程度评估。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具有初步的DIQA能力，但存在关键限制：评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判。思维链提示显著提升了所有层次的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准测试，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显不足，并指出了改进的可行途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

### [74] [BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421)
*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个新颖的类增量学习框架，通过限制在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行模型适应，不增加额外参数或推理成本。它使用正交低秩融合机制防止遗忘，并通过跨模态混合原型提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP应用于类增量学习面临两个主要挑战：需要额外可学习模块增加模型复杂度和遗忘风险；现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的优势来有效整合视觉和文本模态。

Method: BOFA框架将所有模型适应限制在CLIP现有的跨模态桥接层，使用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新约束在数学构造的低秩"安全子空间"中，该子空间与过去任务特征正交。同时采用结合稳定文本原型和视觉对应物的跨模态混合原型。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，BOFA在准确性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BOFA通过桥接层正交融合适应，实现了无数据回放的稳定知识积累，在类增量学习中取得了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [75] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应教学范式来解决视觉-脑电信号不对称对齐问题，通过让视觉模态动态调整其知识结构以适应脑电模态的能力，在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉和脑电模态之间的根本不对称性，包括保真度差距（EEG噪声与视觉高保真特征）和语义差距（EEG浅层概念表示与视觉丰富语义深度），导致泛化性能差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，让"教师"模态（视觉）在任务指导下动态收缩和调整知识结构，使用ShrinkAdapter模块（无残差设计和瓶颈结构）来匹配"学生"模态（EEG）的能力。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最先进方法高出9.8个百分点。

Conclusion: 教师必须收缩和适应以弥合视觉-脑电差距，为不对称对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

TL;DR: WEAVE是首个用于上下文交织跨模态理解和生成的套件，包含WEAVE-100k大规模数据集和WEAVEBench人工标注基准，旨在解决现有方法在多轮、上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和基准主要关注单轮交互，无法捕捉现实世界图像创建和编辑的多轮、上下文依赖特性，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建WEAVE-100k数据集（10万交织样本，37万对话轮次，50万图像）和WEAVEBench基准（100个任务，480张图像），采用基于参考图像和编辑指令组合的混合VLM评判器评估框架。

Result: 在WEAVE-100k上训练能够提升视觉理解、图像编辑以及理解-生成协作能力，促进UMMs发展出新兴的视觉记忆能力。

Conclusion: WEAVE为多模态社区研究上下文交织理解和生成提供了视角和基础，揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的持续局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [77] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，重点关注多模态图标性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。作者提出了一个评估框架来区分识别（模型是否识别引用）和实现（模型如何通过复制或重新诠释来描绘引用），并评估了五个扩散模型在767个文化引用上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊界限，特别是文化引用在模型中的表现方式，探索模型如何在识别文化参考与复制文化参考之间取得平衡。

Method: 引入了一个评估框架，将识别（reference recognition）与实现（realization）分开，通过量化指标捕捉这两个维度。评估了五个扩散模型在767个从Wikidata获取的文化引用上的表现，包括静态和动态图像。还进行了提示扰动实验，使用同义词替换和字面图像描述来评估语言敏感性。

Result: 该框架比现有的基于相似性的方法更能有效区分复制与转换。模型即使文本线索被改变，也经常重现标志性的视觉结构。文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于它们复制的内容，还在于它们如何转换和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，朝着更丰富的语境理解发展。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个基于大脑皮层层次结构的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按早期/中期/晚期视觉区域分组，构建与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，实现高效且可解释的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器直接基于fMRI特征进行条件化，忽视了大脑皮层中视觉信息的层次组织方式，模糊了不同视觉区域的功能角色。

Method: 使用ROI适配器将fMRI信号分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为多尺度皮层金字塔；采用轻量级、深度匹配的ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定的提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集上的实验表明，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 基于皮层层次结构构建条件化是纯数据驱动嵌入的强大替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

TL;DR: VP-Bench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）视觉提示感知和利用能力的基准测试，包含两个评估阶段：视觉提示感知能力和下游任务应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未系统评估MLLMs对视觉提示（如边界框）的解读能力，这种直观的人类提示方法在MLLMs中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示，涵盖8种形状和355种属性组合；第二阶段研究视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLMs（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3和Qwen2.5-VL等），全面分析了影响视觉提示理解的因素，如视觉提示属性变化、问题安排和模型规模。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLMs如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的参考问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes. Extensive experiments further demonstrate strong cross-modality transfer, robustness to linguistic variations and clinical language, as well as accurate instance-specific segmentation from real-world text.

*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MaMOL的框架，通过多任务学习方式处理遥感多模态分类中的模态缺失问题，采用双路由机制实现参数高效适应，在多个基准测试中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致的模态缺失问题，现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时具有完整多模态数据，限制了其在现实世界不完整性中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL)框架，将模态缺失重新表述为多任务学习问题。采用双路由机制：任务导向的动态路由器自适应激活不同缺失模式的专家，以及模态特定共享的静态路由器维持稳定的跨模态知识共享。通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，在不同缺失率下均取得良好性能，且计算开销最小。在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL是一个通用且高效的解决方案，适用于不完整多模态学习，通过多任务学习框架和双路由机制有效解决了模态缺失问题，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)方法，通过分析LVLM对先前生成标记的注意力来检测对象幻觉，无需额外训练即可实时识别幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在对象幻觉问题，研究发现模型在幻觉预测中往往忽略图像而依赖先前生成的标记来推断新对象。

Method: 引入Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，这是一种基于注意力权重的轻量级信号，通过分析模型对prelim标记的注意力来检测幻觉，无需额外前向传播。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的对象幻觉检测性能，能够进行实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: PAS是一种有效的训练无关方法，通过利用先前被忽视的注意力信号，显著提升了对象幻觉检测能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

*Roman Kinakh,Gonzalo R. Ríos-Muñoz,Arrate Muñoz-Barrutia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织学图像推断PD-L1表达，在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上实现了0.805的Dice分数和0.709的IoU，并提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建贝叶斯分割框架，在循环训练期间采样多样化模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差实现准确分割和认知不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，该方法达到0.805的平均Dice分数和0.709的平均IoU，不确定性估计与分割误差有强相关性但校准仍不完美。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

### [84] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的视觉-语言融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向交叉注意力层来对齐视觉和文本的隐藏状态，在保持编码器效率的同时提升多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含丰富的模态特定结构，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部添加少量仅交叉的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间，进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新返回，使用简单稳定器改善对齐。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比较的视觉-语言模型，同时保持对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种有效的视觉-语言融合方法，通过轻量级模块实现模态对齐，在保持编码器理解能力的同时提升多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

*Felix George,Harshit Kumar,Divya Pathak,Kaustabha Ray,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个无监督循环检测框架，结合结构和语义分析来识别LLM驱动应用中隐藏的执行循环，这些循环会消耗资源但不触发显式错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可观测性平台无法检测LLM应用中非确定性行为形成的隐藏执行循环，这些循环会默默消耗资源而不触发显式错误。

Method: 采用混合方法：首先应用计算高效的时间调用栈分析识别显式循环，然后利用语义相似性分析发现以冗余内容生成为特征的微妙循环。

Result: 在LangGraph股票市场应用的1575条轨迹上评估，混合方法F1得分为0.72（精确率：0.62，召回率：0.86），显著优于单独的结构方法（F1：0.08）和语义方法（F1：0.28）。

Conclusion: 虽然结果令人鼓舞，但仍有很大改进空间，未来工作需要完善方法并解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多轮交互分析方法，用于军事仿真推演的数据分析和性能评估，通过任务分解、自定义工具和报告模板生成高质量分析报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工分析方法耗时且易出错，而单次指令输入大语言模型无法获得格式良好的高质量分析报告，需要更有效的方法来提升军事仿真推演分析的效率和准确性。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为子任务，为每个子任务设计系统提示和用户提示，通过多轮交互结合自检和反思进行结构化数据提取和多步分析评估，定义自定义工具生成图表和计算指标，并设计多种报告模板。

Result: 广泛评估结果表明，该方法生成的报告质量更高，相比基线方法获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效生成高质量、结构化的军事仿真推演分析报告，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过离线数据增强和高效并行检索的结构化情景记忆系统，解决了历史人物对话系统中深度与延迟的权衡问题，在保持低延迟的同时实现深度对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在历史人物对话系统中面临深度与延迟的权衡：简单检索增强生成产生浅层响应，而多阶段反思虽然深度足够但延迟过高。

Method: 将传记数据转化为1774个增强的第一人称记忆，带有情感语义元数据，采用两阶段检索实现0.52秒的提示生成。

Result: 评估显示该方法在GPT-4上与传统RAG性能相当，在较小模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-3）上显著优于传统RAG，特别适合资源受限部署。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅作为对话界面，还作为传记分析的研究工具，具有时空热图、情感轨迹分析和交互路径跟踪等可视化功能，可推广到任何有大量文本记录的历史人物。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型HyQuT，该模型能够在8M和150M参数规模下将变分量子电路集成到Transformer框架中，实现连贯且上下文感知的对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子计算已越来越多地应用于替代经典计算，但大多数现有的量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。

Method: 提出的HyQuT架构在Transformer框架中集成了变分量子电路（VQCs），在8M和150M参数规模下进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅需少量量子比特（10个量子比特和80个量子门）即可替代150M参数模型中约10%的经典参数，同时实现相当的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究为将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型提供了早期可行性证明。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理时间约束时存在系统性风险，包括双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，即使通过微调也无法可靠学习时间约束满足能力，需要新的架构机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM在需要实时决策的智能体架构中是否能够可靠地判断行动窗口是否开放或已关闭，这一假设尚未经过验证。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务对8个生产级模型(2.8-8B参数)进行时间约束处理特征分析，并通过200个合成示例进行微调实验。

Result: 发现系统性部署风险：双峰性能分布(模型准确率要么95%要么50%)、极端提示脆弱性(仅格式变化就导致30-60个百分点波动)、系统性行动偏见(失败模型100%假阳性率)。参数数量与能力无相关性。微调仅能部分改善性能。

Conclusion: 时间约束满足能力无法通过自然语言的下一个词预测可靠学习，需要具备连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统组合推理的新架构机制，当前自回归架构缺乏这些机制。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了谱神经符号推理框架，引入了三个基于语义的增强：基于transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴含验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在保持核心谱推理流程的同时提升图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱神经符号推理框架在节点冗余、边质量和上下文缺失方面存在不足，需要更有效的语义预处理来提升推理性能。

Method: 提出三种语义增强方法：(1)使用上下文嵌入进行transformer节点合并，(2)使用预训练NLI分类器进行句子级蕴含验证，(3)与外部知识图谱对齐以补充缺失上下文。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中显示准确率提升达3.8%，对抗性案例泛化能力增强，推理噪声降低。

Conclusion: 通过在谱推理阶段前进行语义和符号精化，实现了高效、可解释且可扩展的推理系统，适用于开放领域和现实世界部署。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动指定偏好权重，增加了用户负担且导致训练效率低下，需要自动推断偏好权重的方法。

Method: 使用轻量级偏好适配器，通过训练多个奖励模型的归一化奖励分数来自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重。

Result: 理论分析和多任务实验证明该方法在多目标对齐场景中优于固定偏好权重方法。

Conclusion: PRO框架有效解决了多目标对齐中的偏好权重自动推断问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的专利嵌入方法，通过利用专利文档内部的不同章节（如摘要、权利要求、背景技术）作为多视图来学习更好的专利表示。该方法解决了SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上导致嵌入过度均匀化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SimCSE风格的dropout增强方法在专利数据上存在失败模式，会产生过度均匀的嵌入表示，丢失语义内聚性。专利文档天然具有丰富的内部结构，不同章节提供了互补的语义信息，这为多视图对比学习提供了理想条件。

Method: 提出基于专利章节的增强方法，将专利文档的不同部分（摘要、权利要求、背景技术等）作为对比学习的多个视图。这种方法引入了自然的语义和结构多样性，避免了过度分散问题，能够更好地保持全局结构和局部连续性。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在现有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时避免了依赖脆弱或不完整的标注。分析表明不同章节专门适用于不同任务：权利要求和摘要有利于检索，背景技术有助于分类。

Conclusion: 专利文档固有的语篇结构对于表示学习具有重要价值，利用文档内部视图可以实现可扩展和泛化性强的专利理解。该方法展示了利用专利内部结构进行多视图对比学习的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

Motivation: 解决现有研究局限于单一任务、有限模型和英文报告的不足，探索开源LLM在多疾病、多语言、多机构临床记录中的结构化信息提取能力。

Method: 使用15个开源LLM（包括通用和医学专用模型），在6种疾病用例中应用6种提示策略（零样本、单样本、少样本、思维链、自一致性和提示图），通过共识排名聚合和线性混合效应模型量化性能差异。

Result: 表现最佳的模型在各项任务中达到接近评分者间一致性的宏观平均分数；中小型通用模型与大型模型性能相当；提示图和少样本提示使性能提升约13%；任务特定因素对结果影响大于模型大小或提示策略。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

TL;DR: iMAD是一个智能多智能体辩论框架，通过选择性触发辩论来显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多智能体辩论框架对所有查询都进行辩论，计算成本高且可能降低准确性，因此需要一种更智能的选择性辩论机制。

Method: iMAD首先让单个智能体生成结构化自我批评响应，从中提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征，然后使用轻量级辩论决策分类器决定是否触发多智能体辩论。

Result: 在六个视觉问答数据集上的实验表明，iMAD显著减少了令牌使用量（最高达92%），同时提高了最终答案准确率（最高达13.5%）。

Conclusion: iMAD通过智能选择性地触发多智能体辩论，实现了计算效率和准确性的双重提升，为LLM智能体系统提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

*Qihang Zhang,Muchen Li,Ziao Wang,Renjie Liao,Lele Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过加权专家乘积进行测试时引导的新框架，将通用压缩模型与预训练神经语言模型自适应结合，确保压缩率至少与最佳单个模型一样好，无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通用压缩器计算开销低、速度快、适用性广但压缩率较差，而神经压缩器能更好建模数据分布但泛化能力不足，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 使用加权专家乘积框架，在推理时自适应地结合通用压缩模型和预训练神经语言模型，确保压缩率不低于最佳单个模型。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，并能与任何自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯方法来量化大型语言模型(LLM)二进制评估指标中的统计不确定性，特别关注由概率文本生成策略引起的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的文本生成系统评估往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而现有的评估方法通常依赖于精心策划的基准输入提示集，并以二进制方式评估输出结果。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来量化二进制评估指标中的不确定性，重点关注LLM系统中概率文本生成策略引起的不确定性。通过两个案例研究验证该方法：1)评估对抗性输入上的拒绝率；2)评估开放对话示例中的成对偏好。

Result: 贝叶斯方法能够为基于LLM的系统行为提供有用的不确定性量化，在对抗性输入拒绝率和LLM偏好比较两个案例中都展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法可以有效量化LLM评估中的统计不确定性，为评估基于LLM的文本生成系统行为提供了更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: 本文对7个前沿大语言模型在粤语、日语和土耳其语上的表现进行了全面评估，涵盖问答、摘要、翻译和文化对话四个任务，结合人工评估和自动指标分析模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言如英语上表现优异，但在低资源和形态丰富语言中的有效性尚未充分探索，需要评估模型在多语言和文化背景下的表现。

Method: 创建跨语言基准测试，涵盖粤语、日语和土耳其语，包含四个任务：开放域问答、文档摘要、英译X和文化对话，结合人工评估（流畅度、事实准确性、文化适宜性）和自动指标（BLEU、ROUGE）。

Result: 最大的专有模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4、Claude 3.5）在多数语言和任务中领先，但在文化细微理解和形态泛化方面仍有显著差距。GPT-4o在跨语言任务中表现稳健，Claude 3.5在知识和推理基准上具有竞争力。所有模型都在各语言独特挑战上存在困难，如土耳其语的粘着形态和粤语口语表达。小型开源模型（LLaMA-2-13B、Mistral-7B）在流畅度和准确性上大幅落后。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具文化意识和语言泛化能力的大语言模型，基准测试和评估数据已发布以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督框架，通过使用偏斜感知聚合策略来增强保护模型的语义鲁棒性，减少语义变异性58%，提高基准准确率2.5%，并改善模型校准40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型对表面语言变化的敏感性是LLM安全的关键漏洞，即使意义保持不变的改写也会导致安全评分大幅波动，表明缺乏语义基础。

Method: 引入实用的自监督框架，利用改写集通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制执行预测一致性，以计算鲁棒目标。

Result: 分析六个开源保护模型显示，该方法将跨改写的语义变异性减少约58%，平均基准准确率提高约2.5%，并能泛化到未见过的风格变化。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调将语义一致性作为首要训练目标的价值，并为构建更可靠保护模型提供了可扩展方案，揭示了模型校准与一致性之间的双向关系。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然预测准确率高，但正确性并不等同于真正的理解能力。需要评估模型是否能像人类专家一样，在多个实例和不同领域中做出基于相关决策因素的一致、有依据的决策。

Method: 引入结构化表格决策模拟(STaDS)，将LLMs视为参加结构化决策"考试"的专业人士，通过三个维度联合评估理解能力：问题与指令理解、基于知识的预测、对相关决策因素的依赖。

Result: 对9个前沿LLMs在15个不同决策场景中的分析显示：(a)大多数模型难以在多样化领域实现持续强准确性；(b)模型可能准确但不忠实，陈述理由与驱动预测的因素之间存在频繁不匹配。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要全局层面的理解评估协议，并倡导超越准确率的新框架来增强LLMs的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Motivation: 人工耳蜗植入显著改善重度至极重度感音神经性听力损失儿童的口语能力，但结果变异性较大，且无法通过植入年龄或残余听力可靠预测个体儿童的结果。

Method: 使用基于脑神经解剖特征的传统机器学习和深度迁移学习算法，构建二元分类模型预测高语言改善者与低语言改善者，采用双线性注意力融合策略。

Result: 深度迁移学习预测模型达到92.39%的准确率、91.22%的敏感性和93.56%的特异性，AUC为0.977，在所有结果指标上均优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 深度迁移学习通过直接捕获判别性和任务特定信息，在表示学习方面具有优势，支持开发适用于全球人工耳蜗项目的单一预测模型的可行性。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Conclusion: 所提出的MoE语音投影器和多阶段训练范式能够有效解决CS语音翻译中的语义建模和数据稀缺问题，为这一挑战性任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题严重影响了其可靠性，现有的微调方法改进有限，无法深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: GVF微调整合了三个核心机制：事实锚点数据增强（用结构化事实锚点和反事实提示丰富训练数据）、事实感知指令调整（将事实线索嵌入显式指令）、事实一致性损失函数（专门惩罚事实不准确性）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B模型上评估，GVF微调在VHTest基准测试中显著优于标准微调，在开放式问题和是/否问题格式上都表现出色。同时，在MME和POPE等多模态基准测试中保持或略微提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF方法有效缓解了视觉幻觉问题，同时不损害模型的一般理解和推理能力，为提升多模态大语言模型的可靠性提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有的演示选择方法主要关注测试输入与演示之间的语义相似性，往往忽略了标签分布对齐的重要性，这限制了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的性能。

Method: 提出两阶段演示选择方法：首先基于语义相似性选择TopK候选演示，然后使用微调的BERT类小型语言模型生成标签分布并计算其散度，选择标签分布与测试输入对齐的演示。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型的性能与用于标签分布估计的小型语言模型的准确性呈正相关，标签分布对齐是改进上下文学习演示选择的关键因素。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和全球变暖主要由温室气体排放引起，而消费品生产、使用和处置是主要排放源。因此需要构建工具来评估消费品对环境的影响，其中生命周期评估（LCA）是重要组成部分。

Method: SpiderGen将传统LCA的分类学和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识相结合，生成用于LCA的程序信息。

Result: SpiderGen提供准确或仅有轻微错误的LCA过程信息，在10个样本数据点上达到62%的F1分数。相比基线技术（如思维链提示和单样本提示）表现更好。

Conclusion: SpiderGen有潜力显著减少估算碳影响所需的人力和成本，能够在10分钟内以不到1美元的成本生成LCA过程信息，而传统LCA可能需要超过25000美元和21人天。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Conclusion: 仅运行现有攻击基准测试可能不足以揭示模型和对齐方法的所有漏洞，需要基于统计的系统性分析来评估模型安全性。

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多轮对话测试发现大语言模型在重复提问下存在显著脆弱性，简单的"再想想"提示可导致准确率下降约10%，结合语义等效重述问题可造成7.5%的准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型应用范围扩大，用户与模型的交互频率和规模增加，需要评估模型在真实任务中的鲁棒性，特别是在交互式场景下的稳定性。

Method: 使用简单的多轮后续提示评估模型回答变化，通过马尔可夫链分析多轮准确率动态，并检验线性探针是否能预测这些变化。

Result: 发现LLM存在显著脆弱性："再想想"提示导致Gemini 1.5 Flash在九轮对话中准确率下降约10%；模型准确率可通过马尔可夫链有效建模，预测长期稳定准确率比首轮低约8%；线性探针可帮助预测未来回答变化。

Conclusion: 研究确立了稳态准确率作为交互式场景下的原则性鲁棒性指标，揭示了模型在重复提问下的脆弱性，解决这种不稳定性对于在高风险交互场景中部署LLM至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究递归提示下大语言模型的性别偏见放大风险，发现存在均衡动态而非单调放大，低初始偏见会放大，高初始偏见会衰减。对比增强方法能显著减少下游偏见，但语义相似度指标与行为公平结果存在分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归提示虽然能扩展合成数据集生成，但存在偏见放大风险，需要研究偏见动态和缓解策略的有效性。

Method: 使用三种评估框架（基于规则的模式匹配、基于嵌入的语义相似度、下游任务性能），在三种初始偏见水平和四种缓解策略下进行三代递归文本生成实验。

Result: 低初始偏见向模型固有偏见水平放大36%，高初始偏见衰减26%。对比增强方法在下游任务中显著减少偏见（低初始偏见减少98.8%，平均减少91%），但产生更高的嵌入偏见分数。

Conclusion: 语义相似度指标可能与行为公平结果不一致，需要在负责任合成数据生成中进行多维评估。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态系统的隐藏语言提供了新视角，为未来多模态系统的可解释性和可控性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用于生成结构化输出，但现有的结构化生成方法虽然能确保有效性，却往往缺乏输出多样性，这是一个关键限制。

Method: 利用自动机遍历历史来引导LLMs朝向新颖的结构模式，通过记录和分析自动机状态转换路径来促进多样性生成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

*Zijian Chen,Wenjun Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Squid Game是一个动态对抗性评估环境，通过资源受限和信息不对称的交互游戏来评估大语言模型，包含六个淘汰式关卡，测试指令遵循、代码、推理、规划和安全对齐等多方面能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试难以跟上大语言模型发展，存在数据污染问题，且主要假设良性、资源丰富的环境，缺乏对模型在压力下行为的探索。

Method: 设计了包含六个淘汰式关卡的动态对抗评估环境，让LLM与其他LLM对手进行交互游戏，评估了50多个模型。

Result: 观察到同一模型谱系中明显的代际性能转变，发现一些模型采用投机取巧策略获胜，表明静态基准可能存在更高级别的评估范式污染。

Conclusion: 动态评估可以作为静态评估的补充，Squid Game提供了在动态对抗场景下大规模行为评估的研究框架。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

TL;DR: 研究表明AI语音系统能够隐式学习人类社交规范，在礼貌提示下会显著降低语速来传达礼貌，这与人类沟通模式一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究最先进的文本转语音系统是否内化了人类通过降低语速来表达礼貌的非明显韵律标记，验证AI能否学习未明确编程的隐含社交线索。

Method: 使用两个领先AI平台（AI Studio和OpenAI）的22个合成声音，在"礼貌正式"和"随意非正式"两种条件下朗读固定脚本，测量生成的语音时长。

Result: 两个AI平台的礼貌提示都产生了比随意提示更慢的语速，效应量非常大。AI Studio的所有声音和OpenAI的大多数声音都显示出统计显著性差异。

Conclusion: AI能够隐式学习和复制人类沟通的心理细微差别，突显其作为能够强化人类社交规范的社会行为者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大型语言模型在国际关系领域的国家层面偏见，基于联合国安理会历史记录开发了偏见评估框架，发现模型存在多维偏见且随任务变化，并提出结合检索增强生成和反思技术的去偏见框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是系统评估LLMs在国际关系领域的国家层面偏见，特别是针对联合国安理会五个常任理事国，以了解模型偏见的多维特性及其对IR应用的影响。

Method: 基于联合国安理会历史记录开发了包含三个测试的偏见评估框架，并提出了结合检索增强生成（RAG）和基于反思的自反思技术的去偏见框架。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs存在国家层面偏见（如对西方国家的有利偏见和对俄罗斯的不利偏见），偏见随模型和任务变化，推理能力强的模型偏见较小。去偏见框架有效减少了偏见并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调在IR领域应用LLMs时需要同时评估国家层面偏见和性能，提出的去偏见框架为减少模型偏见提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ΠAttention是一种周期性稀疏Transformer，通过将注意力分解为环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，在保持线性复杂度的同时扩展感受野，在语言建模等任务中优于RingAttention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模能力，现有稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention虽然降低了计算成本，但感受野有限且缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出ΠAttention，将注意力分解为三个部分：环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，通过周期性结构覆盖远距离token，同时保持稀疏性实现线性复杂度。

Result: ΠAttention在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中达到或超过密集注意力的质量，困惑度比RingAttention低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用量减少50%。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头级稀疏协调对于高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持线性复杂度的同时显著扩展了感受野。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Conclusion: 忠实度是可靠医疗摘要的重要维度，该方法展示了在医疗环境中更安全部署大语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Motivation: 大语言模型在教育评估任务中的应用日益增多，但其在真实课堂环境中与人类评估的一致性尚未得到充分研究，需要验证LLM在实际教育场景中的评分可靠性。

Method: 收集约50名学生的五次测验简答题和14个团队的项目报告，使用GPT-4o进行评分，并与课程助教独立进行的人工评分进行比较分析。

Result: GPT-4o与人类评分员表现出强相关性（最高0.98），55%的测验分数完全一致。项目报告评分总体与人类评分一致，但在技术性开放回答评分上存在一定变异性。

Conclusion: LLM在教育评估中具有潜力但也存在局限性，特别是在技术性开放回答的评分方面需要改进，研究为推进真实学术环境中的自动评分系统提供了参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Motivation: 探索多语言大语言模型如何内部表示语言多样性，理解为什么性能仍然偏向主导训练语言，以及模型是否形成共享的多语言表示和语言特定的解码机制。

Method: 训练一系列在不同多语言数据混合上的LLMs，使用跨层转码器(CLT)和归因图分析内部机制，通过干预语言特征进行实验。

Result: 发现模型采用枢轴语言表示机制，解码部分依赖于最后一层中的高频语言特征，这些特征从模型第一层线性读取语言身份。通过干预这些特征可以控制语言输出。

Conclusion: 理解枢轴语言机制对于改进LLMs中的多语言对齐至关重要，主导训练语言通过归因图和解码路径影响这些机制。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了情感识别模型在非洲裔美国英语(AAVE)与通用美国英语(GAE)上的性能差异，发现模型在AAVE文本上对愤怒情绪的误判率显著高于GAE，存在种族偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感检测模型主要基于主流文化规范的标注数据，难以准确识别被排除在训练数据之外的方言（如AAVE）中的情感表达，可能导致对特定群体的偏见。

Method: 研究分析了270万条洛杉矶地理标记推文，通过计算方言特征强度对文本进行AAVE密度评分，收集了875条推文的情感存在和强度标注，并使用社区知情标注方法。

Result: GPT和BERT模型在AAVE文本上的愤怒误判率是GAE的两倍以上；SpanEmo模型的愤怒误判率从GAE的25%上升到AAVE的60%；模型预测与非洲裔居民比例呈正相关（愤怒r=0.27，喜悦r=-0.10）。

Conclusion: 情感AI存在强化种族刻板印象的安全风险，需要开发文化和方言知情的情感计算系统。

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回应方面达到中低水平人类表现，但在共情能力上明显不足，且与人类在幽默评估标准上存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖单维度评估LLMs的幽默能力，本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，通过Oogiri游戏填补这一研究空白。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，用LLMs生成回应，手动标注六个维度的5点绝对评分，评估LLMs在生成和评估两个核心任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs能生成中低水平人类表现的幽默回应，但缺乏共情能力；相关性分析显示LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评估方面与人类存在根本差异，释放标注语料库以推动开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于参数空间对齐的任务算术方法，通过利用Transformer架构的对称性来减少模型合并时的负干扰，成功将高级推理技能迁移到非推理模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务算术在大型语言模型间转移技能时经常受到负干扰的影响，特别是当模型在训练过程中出现分歧时。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 首先对齐模型的参数空间，利用Transformer架构的固有对称性（置换、旋转和缩放），并针对现代GQA和SwiGLU层调整参数空间对齐，探索基于权重和基于激活的方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法始终优于标准任务算术，成功将高级推理技能转移到非推理模型中。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不断发展的LLM家族之间合并和转移专门技能提供了有效方法，减少了冗余的微调并增强了模型适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，将任务从直接事实查询重构为对话判断任务时，LLM的判断会发生变化。通过对比模型在直接事实查询和对话场景中的表现，发现即使是最小对话上下文也能显著改变模型判断，平均性能变化达9.24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM作为评判者在需要社交或对话判断的任务中是否可靠，特别关注任务从直接事实查询转变为对话判断任务时模型判断的变化。

Method: 构建评估框架，对比模型在直接事实查询和最小对话场景中的表现，通过简单反驳施加压力来测量模型立场的坚定程度。

Result: 不同模型表现出不同倾向：GPT-4o-mini在社会框架任务中显示奉承倾向，而Llama-8B-Instruct变得过度批判。所有模型平均性能变化9.24%。

Conclusion: 对话框架是LLM评估的关键因素，提出的框架为诊断模型信念提供了可复现方法，有助于开发更可信的对话系统。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

*Jongyoon Song,Sangwon Yu,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了LLMs在二元决策任务中表现出格式级负向偏见，即提示格式比负面回答语义更影响模型响应。研究发现模型在缺乏足够知识时会通过捷径行为生成负面回答，导致负向偏见。不同提示场景下负向偏见程度不同：提供相关上下文和"我不知道"选项可减少偏见，而思维链提示会放大偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测和处理引发负向偏见的负向注意力头，但对影响负向偏见的详细因素探索不足。本文旨在深入分析负向偏见的具体影响因素。

Method: 引入构建评估集的流程，将数据集系统分类为正确、错误和知识不足三个子集。通过分析这些子集，识别模型在缺乏足够知识时生成负面回答的捷径行为。进一步研究不同提示场景下负向偏见的变化。

Result: 发现模型在缺乏足够知识时倾向于生成负面回答，导致负向偏见。提供相关上下文和"我不知道"选项能减少偏见，而思维链提示会放大偏见。不同提示类型会影响偏见程度和响应方向。

Conclusion: 揭示了影响负向偏见的多种因素，为减轻LLMs中的负向偏见提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别和实体链接领域的数据碎片化问题，缺乏可解释模型资源，以及语义盲评估指标的局限性。

Method: 基于9个现有专家标注的实体链接数据集构建MedPath数据集，使用UMLS最新版本标准化所有实体，映射到62个其他生物医学词汇表，并丰富完整的本体路径（从通用到具体）。

Result: 创建了一个大规模多领域生物医学实体链接数据集，支持在多达11个生物医学词汇表中进行语义丰富的实体链接。

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

*Farima Fatahi Bayat,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了工具增强语言模型（TaLMs）在使用代码解释器工具时出现的"工具诱导短视"（TIM）现象，即模型将工具输出作为推理的替代品，导致解决方案看似正确但缺乏连贯论证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然TaLMs能够调用外部工具解决超出其参数能力的问题，但这些工具带来的性能提升是否反映可信的推理过程尚不明确。

Method: 使用PYMATH基准测试（包含1,679个竞赛级数学问题），开发多维评估套件量化TaLMs相对于非工具模型的推理退化，并提出基于偏好优化的框架来重新调整TaLMs将工具用作辅助证据。

Result: TaLMs在最终答案准确率上获得高达19.3个百分点的提升，但推理行为一致恶化（非工具LLMs在推理过程成对比较中胜出高达41.5%）。工具使用越频繁，推理连贯性越差，错误从算术错误转向全局推理失败（逻辑、假设、创造力），约55%的高风险案例存在TIM现象。

Conclusion: 工具使用虽然提高答案准确性，但损害推理质量。提出的偏好优化框架能够改善工具使用下的最终答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在医学问答中往往忽视领域专业知识（如临床学科和认证级别），限制了在高风险环境下的性能表现。

Method: 开发了EMSQA数据集，并提出Expert-CoT（基于特定临床学科和认证级别的思维链提示）和ExpertRAG（基于学科对齐文档和真实患者数据的检索增强生成管道）。

Result: Expert-CoT相比普通CoT提示提升达2.05%；结合Expert-CoT和ExpertRAG相比标准RAG基线提升达4.59%；32B专业知识增强的LLMs通过了所有计算机自适应EMS认证模拟考试。

Conclusion: 通过整合领域专业知识（临床学科和认证级别），可以显著提升LLMs在医学问答任务中的性能，特别是在高风险医疗环境中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

TL;DR: DiscoX是一个用于评估专业领域语篇级中英翻译的新基准，包含7个领域的200篇专业文本。研究还开发了无参考评估系统Metric-S，实验显示即使最先进的LLM在专业翻译任务上仍与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译评估方法主要关注句子级准确性和流畅性，无法充分评估专业领域语篇级翻译所需的连贯性和术语精确性。

Method: 构建DiscoX基准数据集（200篇专业文本，平均长度超过1700词），开发无参考评估系统Metric-S，对先进LLM进行实验评估。

Result: Metric-S与人工评估高度一致，显著优于现有评估指标。实验显示最先进LLM在专业翻译任务上仍明显落后于人类专家。

Conclusion: DiscoX基准和Metric-S评估系统为更严格的翻译评估提供了可靠框架，揭示了实现专业级机器翻译仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

TL;DR: 本文对主流开源DPO数据集进行了首次全面的数据中心分析，使用Magpie框架标注样本质量，并基于分析结果构建了新的DPO混合数据集UltraMix，该数据集比性能最佳的单数据集小30%但性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数前沿LLM不公开其精心策划的偏好对，而开源DPO数据集缺乏系统比较，主要由于计算成本高和缺乏丰富的质量标注，难以理解偏好如何选择、涵盖哪些任务类型以及它们在样本级别上反映人类判断的程度。

Method: 利用Magpie框架为每个样本标注任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励，这是一个基于奖励模型的信号，可在不依赖人工标注的情况下验证偏好顺序。基于这些洞察，从五个语料库中有选择地构建新的DPO混合数据集UltraMix，同时移除噪声或冗余样本。

Result: 揭示了数据集间奖励边界的结构和质量差异。UltraMix比性能最佳的单数据集小30%，但在关键基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心的偏好优化方法，可以构建更小但性能更好的DPO数据集，为未来的数据中心偏好优化研究提供了有价值的资源和见解。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks.

### [135] [Correcting Mean Bias in Text Embeddings: A Refined Renormalization with Training-Free Improvements on MMTEB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11041)
*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现当前文本嵌入模型存在一致的偏差，并提出了一种无需训练、轻量级的重归一化方法，能够显著提升模型在MMTEB基准上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前文本嵌入模型的输出存在系统性偏差，即所有嵌入向量都包含一个几乎相同的偏差分量，这影响了模型的性能表现。

Method: 提出重归一化方法，有两种变体：直接减去偏差分量μ，或减去向量在μ方向上的投影。该方法无需额外训练，可直接应用于现有模型。

Result: 在38个模型上的实验表明，重归一化显著提升了MMTEB基准上的性能：检索任务提升9.7σ，分类任务提升3.1σ，其他任务提升0.8σ。理论预测和实验都证实投影方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 重归一化是一种简单有效的后处理方法，能够显著提升文本嵌入模型的性能，且投影方法优于直接减法。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

### [136] [Can LLMs Detect Their Own Hallucinations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11087)
*Sora Kadotani,Kosuke Nishida,Kyosuke Nishida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型能否检测自身幻觉，提出基于思维链的幻觉检测框架，实验表明GPT-3.5 Turbo能检测58.2%的自身幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型能生成流畅回答但有时会产生事实幻觉，需要研究模型是否能识别自身的幻觉问题。

Method: 将幻觉检测制定为句子分类任务，提出基于思维链的分类方法从模型参数中提取知识。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-3.5 Turbo配合思维链能检测58.2%的自身幻觉。

Conclusion: 如果模型参数包含足够知识，配合思维链的大语言模型能够检测自身幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

*Ruban Goyal,Rohitash Chandra,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析美国总统辩论中人身攻击的框架，通过手动标注2016、2020和2024年选举周期的辩论记录，结合统计和基于语言模型的分析，研究微调转换器模型和通用大语言模型在检测正式政治演讲中人身攻击的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人身攻击已成为美国总统辩论的显著特征，在塑造选举期间公众认知方面发挥重要作用。检测此类攻击可以提高政治话语的透明度，并为记者、分析师和公众提供见解。深度学习和基于转换器的模型（特别是BERT和大语言模型）的进展为自动检测有害语言创造了新机会。

Method: 手动标注2016、2020和2024年选举周期的辩论记录，然后进行统计和基于语言模型的分析。研究微调转换器模型和通用大语言模型在检测正式政治演讲中人身攻击的潜力。

Result: 研究表明，现代语言模型的任务特定适应可以为政治传播的深入理解做出贡献。

Conclusion: 任务特定的现代语言模型适应可以促进对政治传播的更深入理解，为自动检测政治辩论中的人身攻击提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

*Yiming Rong,Yixin Zhang,Ziyi Wang,Deyang Jiang,Yunlong Zhao,Haoran Wu,Shiyu Zhou,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SAP$^{2}$方法，通过两阶段动态剪枝和整合相关上下文关键词来解决ASR系统在长上下文场景中的性能问题，在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在常见条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识的上下文场景中难以有效利用长上下文信息，主要受限于模型上下文窗口和大量上下文噪声中相关信息的稀疏性。

Method: 提出SAP$^{2}$框架，采用两阶段动态剪枝和整合相关上下文关键词，每个阶段利用提出的语音驱动注意力池化机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上分别达到7.71%和1.12%的词错误率，在SlideSpeech上相比非上下文基线显著降低偏置关键词错误率41.1%，在广泛上下文输入条件下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: SAP$^{2}$方法有效解决了ASR系统在长上下文场景中的挑战，实现了最先进的性能，并展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

### [139] [Adverbs Revisited: Enhancing WordNet Coverage of Adverbs with a Supersense Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11214)
*Jooyoung Lee,Jader Martins Camboim de Sá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于语言学的副词超义类型学，扩展了WordNet对副词的语义分类，并通过实证验证证明了该分类系统的可靠性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet为名词和动词提供了丰富的超义层次结构，但副词缺乏系统的语义分类，这限制了其在自然语言处理中的应用。

Method: 引入基于语言学的副词超义类型学，通过标注研究进行实证验证，涵盖方式、时间、频率、程度、领域、说话者导向和主语导向等主要语义域。

Result: 试点标注研究结果表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且人类标注者能够可靠地分配这些类别。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和话语建模等下游NLP应用。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

### [140] [LANE: Lexical Adversarial Negative Examples for Word Sense Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11234)
*Jader Martins Camboim de Sá,Jooyoung Lee,Cédric Pruski,Marcos Da Silveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LANE的对抗性训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，旨在提高神经语言模型在细粒度词义消歧方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型在处理细粒度词义消歧时往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节，这仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: LANE对抗性训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，迫使模型在具有不同标记词的相同句子之间创建更大的可分离性。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法产生了更具区分性的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。定性分析显示，所提出的负样本能够更好地捕捉具有挑战性环境中的细微意义差异。

Conclusion: LANE方法能够有效提高词表示的区分能力，是模型无关的，可以集成到现有的表示学习框架中。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种从知识图谱生成问答对的可扩展确定性流水线，结合LLM提升语言质量，通过聚类三元组、创建模板、LLM优化模板和引入干扰项等步骤生成高质量QA对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、语言质量和事实一致性方面存在不足，需要开发能够高效生成高质量自然语言问答对的方法，以支持教育平台、传播工具和大语言模型的开发测试。

Method: 首先基于关系聚类KG三元组，通过实体类型和关系创建可重用模板；然后使用LLM优化模板以提升清晰度和连贯性；最后通过从KG中选择干扰项的策略实例化答案选项。

Result: 实验表明这种混合方法能够高效生成高质量的QA对，在可扩展性、流畅性和语言精确性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该混合方法成功结合了可扩展性和语言质量，为从知识图谱生成高质量自然语言问答对提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

Motivation: 现有金融LLM（如BloombergGPT、FinMA）计算需求高，限制了组织可访问性，需要开发更高效的模型部署方法。

Method: 提出层自适应集成调优（LAET），通过分析隐藏状态表示选择性微调预训练LLM的最有效层，冻结不太关键的层。

Result: LAET显著降低计算开销，同时提升任务特定性能，在金融NLP任务中表现优于现有基准和最先进的LLM（包括GPT-4），即使使用较小的LLM（约30亿参数）。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了前沿金融NLP研究与实际部署之间的差距，为金融应用提供了高效可扩展的模型。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

Conclusion: M-DAIGT为AI生成文本检测提供了重要基准，并讨论了未来发展方向。

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型与人类婴儿在语言学习能力上的差异，特别是对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现对比。

Method: 回顾文献分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，比较其与人类婴儿学习能力的差异。

Result: 语言模型通常能同等学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，难以学习的不可能语言只是更复杂或随机。语言模型缺乏支持语言习得的人类归纳偏置。

Conclusion: 语言模型在语言学习方面与人类婴儿存在本质差异，主要在于缺乏人类特有的归纳偏置机制。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种主动式听力辅助系统，通过双模型架构实时识别和分离佩戴者的对话伙伴，无需显式提示，利用自我语音作为锚点，基于对话动态进行主动适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够主动适应对话动态的听力辅助设备，无需用户明确提示即可识别和分离对话伙伴，提高在多人对话环境中的听觉体验。

Method: 使用自我中心双耳音频，以佩戴者的自我语音为锚点，利用轮换行为和对话动态推断对话伙伴并抑制其他声音。采用双模型架构：轻量级流式模型每12.5毫秒运行用于低延迟提取，较慢模型较少运行以捕获长程对话动态。

Result: 在真实世界的2人和3人对话测试集上验证，收集了11名参与者共6.8小时的双耳自我中心硬件数据，显示在多对话环境中识别和隔离对话伙伴的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作标志着向主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力辅助设备迈出了一步，能够有效提升在复杂听觉环境中的沟通效果。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRBench是一个针对金融和法律领域的专业推理基准测试，包含1,100个专家编写的任务和19,356个专家制定的评分标准，是这两个领域最大的公开基准测试。对20个领先模型的评估显示在专业推理方面仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学术基准测试无法充分评估模型在现实世界专业环境中的表现，特别是在法律和金融等高风险领域，需要更真实的、开放式的评估方法。

Method: 开发PRBench基准测试，包含1,100个专家编写的任务和19,356个专家制定的评分标准，涵盖114个国家和47个美国司法管辖区。招募182名合格专业人士参与任务设计，并通过严格的质量管道验证评分标准。

Result: 对20个领先模型的评估显示，在Hard子集上的最高得分仅为0.39（金融）和0.37（法律）。模型在特定能力上表现差异显著，常见失败模式包括判断不准确、缺乏过程透明度和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 当前模型在专业推理方面仍有显著不足，特别是在准确性、透明度和完整性方面，限制了其在专业领域的可靠应用。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

### [150] [The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)
*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AI伦理熵的第二定律，证明无约束AI会自发偏离目标，需要持续的对齐工作来维持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI系统在无约束条件下自发偏离预期目标的问题，作者希望建立一个类似热力学第二定律的理论框架，为AI对齐提供量化基础。

Method: 定义了基于目标概率分布的伦理熵S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta)，证明了其时间导数dS/dt >= 0，并推导出对齐工作的临界稳定性边界gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N。

Result: 实验验证了理论：70亿参数模型从初始熵0.32漂移到1.69±1.08 nats，而使用gamma=20.4（1.5倍临界值）对齐工作的系统保持稳定在0.00±0.00 nats。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护高级自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

*Niclas Boehmer,Maximilian T. Wittmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多目标优化中的帕累托剪枝问题，将问题重新定义为多赢家投票问题，分析了现有质量度量的不直观行为，提出了新的定向覆盖度量，并进行了计算复杂性和实验评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实决策问题通常涉及多目标优化，决策者需要从帕累托最优解中选择最偏好的解。为减轻决策者认知负担，需要计算固定大小的帕累托最优解子集来最佳代表完整集合。

Method: 将帕累托剪枝重新定义为多赢家投票问题，进行公理化分析，引入新的定向覆盖度量，分析各种质量度量的计算复杂性，并进行实验评估。

Result: 发现现有质量度量存在不直观行为，新提出的定向覆盖度量在多种设置下表现具有竞争力甚至更优，质量度量的选择对所选解集特征有决定性影响。

Conclusion: 通过公理化分析和实验验证，证明了定向覆盖度量在多目标优化帕累托剪枝问题中的有效性，为决策者提供了更好的解集选择工具。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

### [152] [Structure-Aware Encodings of Argumentation Properties for Clique-width](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10767)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了图的结构参数（如树宽和团宽）在计算复杂性中的作用，特别是针对抽象论证框架的编码问题。作者设计了新的从论证问题到(Q)SAT的归约方法，这些归约线性保持团宽，并建立了所有论证语义（包括计数）的新结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在小树宽实例上表现高效，但关于团宽（一种比树宽更一般的图参数）的编码研究较少。作者希望理解团宽在编码中的能力，选择抽象论证作为研究框架，因为它基于有向图且涉及计算挑战性问题。

Method: 设计了从论证问题到(Q)SAT的新归约方法，这些归约线性保持团宽，称为有向分解引导（DDG）归约。

Result: 为所有论证语义（包括计数）建立了新结果，证明DDG归约引起的开销在合理假设下无法显著改进。

Conclusion: 该研究开启了理解团宽编码能力的新方向，为抽象论证问题提供了高效的(Q)SAT编码方法，且这些方法在团宽保持方面具有最优性。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不确定性下的反事实决策中，决策者通常通过比较候选行动的期望潜在结果来做出选择。本文旨在开发新的决策规则，更准确地评估个体层面的潜在结果排序和获得最佳结果的可能性。

Method: 引入PoR和PoB两个新指标，建立识别定理和边界推导，提出估计方法，并通过数值实验和真实数据集应用来验证方法的有效性。

Result: 成功建立了PoR和PoB的识别理论框架，推导出边界估计，实验表明估计器具有良好的有限样本性能，并在实际数据应用中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的PoR和PoB指标为反事实决策提供了新的分析工具，能够更精确地评估个体层面的潜在结果排序和最优结果获得概率，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

### [154] [From Efficiency to Adaptivity: A Deeper Look at Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10788)

Result: 建立了连接经典认知范式与算法实现的框架，澄清了不同机制在实践中如何实现自适应推理，并支持跨策略的系统比较。

Conclusion: 识别了自我评估、元推理和人类对齐推理控制等开放挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperComplEx是一个混合知识图谱嵌入框架，通过注意力机制自适应结合双曲空间、复数空间和欧几里得空间，解决了现有方法在处理多样化关系类型时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法在处理大规模多样化关系类型时存在关键限制：欧几里得模型难以处理层次结构，向量空间模型无法捕捉不对称关系，双曲模型在对称关系上表现不佳。

Method: 提出关系特定的空间加权策略，通过学习注意力机制为每种关系类型动态选择最优几何空间，同时使用多空间一致性损失确保跨空间预测的一致性。

Result: 在从1K论文到10M论文的知识图谱上评估，相比TransE、RotatE、DistMult等基线方法持续改进。在10M论文数据集上达到0.612 MRR，相对最佳基线提升4.8%，同时保持高效训练和85ms/三元组的推理速度。

Conclusion: HyperComplEx通过自适应维度分配实现近线性扩展，为可扩展知识图谱嵌入研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Method: 采用两阶段协作框架：第一阶段从多模态输入生成自然语言事故重建；第二阶段结合时间事件数据记录器进行深度事故推理，处理277起后车追尾事故数据。

Result: 在39个复杂事故案例评估中，框架在所有测试案例中达到完美准确率，成功识别最相关EDR事件并正确区分撞击与被撞车辆，在处理不完整数据时保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI在处理异构碰撞数据方面的卓越能力，在重建碰撞动力学和表征事故前行为方面提供了前所未有的精确度。

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型作为专家指导的新框架，从不规则采样的纵向患者数据中学习神经退行性疾病进展，特别是阿尔茨海默病的病理传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法过于简化脑连接性关系，假设单一模态的脑连接组作为疾病传播基质，导致病理传播预测不准确。纯数据驱动方法由于缺乏适当约束而面临可识别性问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型作为区域变量相互作用的专家指导，同时优化从个体水平观察构建长期疾病轨迹和捕获脑区间相互作用的生物约束图结构。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合LLMs的多模态关系合成能力，显著提高了疾病进展建模的准确性和生物学合理性，为神经退行性疾病研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体法律验证器，将合规检查分解为法规解释、业务背景评估和风险评估等专门智能体，通过结构化合成协议协调，在AP隐私保护法案例中实现72%准确率，比单智能体基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 领域专业化和协调推理能够显著提高法律AI性能，为可信赖和可解释的自动化合规验证提供了可扩展且符合法规的框架。

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Conclusion: 为使AI系统在复杂现实环境中与人类期望保持一致，需要开发能够整合多种知识类型来构建、评估和证明行动方案的决策机制。

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的不完全方法来打破抽象结构的对称性，通过更好地利用其表示来处理约束编程中的对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束编程中，抽象结构（如嵌套集合）需要通过表示转换才能在求解器中使用。对称性破坏技术可以显著加速求解过程，但应用于抽象变量时会产生大量复杂约束，性能不佳。

Method: 开发了一种新的不完全对称性破坏方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示来处理由不可区分对象引起的对称性问题。

Result: 该方法比之前提出的方法（Akgün等人2025年）更快。

Conclusion: 新方法在破坏抽象结构对称性方面比现有方法更有效，能够更好地处理约束编程中的对称性问题。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

TL;DR: 研究发现多智能体辩论中的角色分配策略对推理性能有显著影响，提出'Truth Last'策略可提升22%性能，并开发了MADC策略来应对实际应用中未知真相的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论在提升LLM推理能力方面有潜力，但角色分配策略这一关键方面尚未充分探索，需要研究不同角色分配对推理任务性能的影响。

Method: 提出'Truth Last'角色分配策略，并开发多智能体辩论一致性(MADC)策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，模拟一致性得分最高的角色作为真相。

Result: 在9个LLM模型上的验证显示，MADC策略持续表现出先进性能，有效克服了MAD的性能瓶颈，在推理任务中提升性能达22%。

Conclusion: MADC策略为LLM智能体扩展提供了重要改进路径，通过系统性模拟和优化多智能体辩论的核心机制，显著提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Conclusion: DSS框架通过结合规划梯度和随机搜索，在自动驾驶规划任务中表现出优越性能，为安全可靠的自动驾驶提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习有效的广义计划和搜索空间剪枝公理，在经典和数值规划领域都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: 几何构造是评估统一多模态模型生成推理能力的理想测试平台，GGBench填补了现有评估方法的空白。

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

### [165] [STaR: Towards Cognitive Table Reasoning via Slow-Thinking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11233)
*Huajian Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Yucong Luo,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR框架通过慢思考机制改进LLM的表格推理能力，采用两阶段难度感知强化学习和轨迹级不确定性量化，提升推理深度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM表格推理方法存在推理过程缺乏深度迭代和稳定性不足的问题，需要更接近人类认知的推理机制。

Method: 提出STaR框架，通过显式建模逐步思考和不确定性感知推理，采用两阶段难度感知强化学习训练，推理时进行轨迹级不确定性量化。

Result: 在基准测试中取得优越性能，推理稳定性显著增强，在领域外数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: STaR作为认知启发的可靠解决方案，为LLM表格推理提供了更稳定和可信的推理路径。

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机密计算技术的AI决策追踪工作流，通过强制记录训练和推理过程中的所有组件，生成防篡改、可验证的完整AI决策痕迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在决策过程文档化方面存在不足，这阻碍了追溯决策依据和建立责任链的能力，特别是在AI决策可能违反法律时，缺乏能在法庭上站得住脚的文档记录。

Method: 将DBOM概念扩展为有效的工作流，利用机密计算技术强制执行训练和推理过程中每个组件的文档记录，支持生成防篡改、可验证的AI决策痕迹。

Result: 开发了一个运行工作流，并在区分有毒和可食用蘑菇的应用开发中演示了该工作流的工作原理。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决AI决策可追溯性问题提供了一种激进但实用的解决方案，为建立AI决策责任链奠定了技术基础。

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了对比ABox解释的概念，用于回答"为什么a是C的实例而b不是"这类问题。相比单独解释正面蕴含或缺失蕴含的方法，对比解释同时考虑两者，能够聚焦于a和b之间的相关共性和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能单独解释为什么某个个体是某个概念的实例（正面蕴含）或为什么不是（缺失蕴含），缺乏同时考虑两者的对比性解释方法。

Method: 针对描述逻辑本体论中的ABox推理，开发了对比解释的适当概念，分析了不同变体在不同最优性标准下的计算复杂性，涵盖了轻量级和更表达性的描述逻辑。

Result: 实现了计算对比解释变体的首个方法，并在现实知识库的生成问题上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 对比ABox解释能够有效回答对比性问题，聚焦于个体间的相关差异，为知识库推理提供了更全面的解释能力。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

TL;DR: RLSLM是一个混合强化学习框架，将基于规则的社会运动模型集成到强化学习的奖励函数中，用于社会感知导航。它结合了机械能和社会舒适度的优化，在VR实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社会感知导航中规则方法缺乏泛化性而数据驱动方法不透明且难以与人类直觉对齐的问题。

Method: 提出RLSLM框架，将基于经验行为实验的社会运动模型集成到强化学习奖励函数中，生成方向敏感的社会舒适场，联合优化机械能和社会舒适度。

Result: 在沉浸式VR实验中，RLSLM在用户体验方面优于最先进的基于规则模型，消融和敏感性分析显示其可解释性显著优于传统数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种可扩展的、以人为中心的方法，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，实现现实世界的社会导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

TL;DR: 本调查系统回顾了在多智能体强化学习中，面对现实通信约束（如消息扰动、传输延迟和有限带宽）时的鲁棒高效通信策略研究进展，重点关注自动驾驶、分布式SLAM和联邦学习三个应用领域，并提出了通信、学习和鲁棒性协同设计的未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法大多假设通信是瞬时、可靠且带宽无限的，但这些条件在现实部署中很少满足，因此需要研究在现实通信约束下的鲁棒高效通信策略。

Method: 系统性地调查和分析了近期在MARL中应对消息扰动、传输延迟和有限带宽等现实通信约束的通信策略研究进展。

Result: 识别了低延迟可靠性、带宽密集型数据共享和通信隐私权衡等核心挑战，并在三个具体应用领域（自动驾驶、分布式SLAM、联邦学习）中展示了相关研究成果。

Conclusion: 提出了通信、学习和鲁棒性协同设计的统一方法，以弥合理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距，并指出了关键开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

TL;DR: CURENet是一个多模态模型，通过整合非结构化临床笔记、实验室测试和患者时间序列数据，利用LLM处理临床文本和文本实验室测试，以及transformer编码器处理纵向顺序就诊数据，用于慢性疾病预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含多种数据类型，但现有预测模型未能充分捕捉多模态数据间的交互、冗余和时间模式，往往只关注单一数据类型或忽视这些复杂性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型处理临床文本和文本实验室测试，使用transformer编码器处理纵向顺序就诊数据，整合多模态EHR数据。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和FEMH数据集上评估，CURENet在多标签框架中预测前10种慢性疾病的准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: 多模态EHR整合有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者结局。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

TL;DR: EGuR是一个在推理时动态生成完整计算策略的AI系统，能够根据积累的经验自适应调整LLM调用、工具使用、采样参数和控制逻辑，相比现有方法在多个基准测试中实现了显著性能提升和计算成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI系统在推理时无法灵活调整采样参数、工具配置、系统提示等核心组件的问题，以及需要离线优化且部署后无法动态适应的问题。

Method: 使用基于LLM的元策略生成完整计算策略，包含两个组件：Guide根据当前问题和历史经验生成候选策略，Consolidator整合执行反馈来改进未来策略生成。

Result: 在五个挑战性基准测试中，EGuR相比最强基线实现了高达14%的准确率提升，同时计算成本降低了111倍，且随着经验积累性能持续提升。

Conclusion: EGuR通过动态生成完整策略的方法，实现了AI系统在推理时的真正自适应能力，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著突破。

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策AI智能体在复杂动态环境中运行时面临与人类价值观或指导方针保持一致的挑战，预训练智能体的对齐尤其困难，因为重新训练成本高昂且缓慢。

Method: 使用模型引导的策略塑造方法，通过场景-动作属性分类器在测试时应用策略塑造，确保决策与伦理属性对齐。在MACHIAVELLI基准上进行评估，包含134个基于文本的游戏环境和数千个涉及伦理决策的标注场景。

Conclusion: 测试时策略塑造是实现AI智能体伦理对齐的有效方法，能够在保持性能的同时确保行为符合伦理规范。

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

TL;DR: MergeBarrier是一种即插即用的防御方法，通过破坏线性模式连接性来主动防止未经授权的模型合并窃取，在保持高性能的同时提供有效保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并技术虽然能高效扩展大语言模型，但也带来了模型合并窃取的新威胁，现有防御机制无法同时满足主动防止未经授权合并、兼容开源设置和低性能损失高安全性这三个关键保护属性。

Method: 提出MergeBarrier防御方法，通过破坏保护模型与其同源模型之间的线性模式连接性，消除有效模型合并所需的低损失路径。

Result: 大量实验表明，MergeBarrier能有效防止模型合并窃取，且准确率损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MergeBarrier为解决模型合并窃取问题提供了一种有效的防御方案，能够在不显著影响性能的前提下保护模型免受未经授权的合并利用。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient technique for expanding large language models (LLMs) by integrating specialized expert models. However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging. The core design of MergeBarrier is to disrupt the Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) between the protected model and its homologous counterparts, thereby eliminating the low-loss path required for effective model merging. Extensive experiments show that MergeBarrier effectively prevents model merging stealing with negligible accuracy loss.

TL;DR: BadThink是一种针对思维链（CoT）提示的后门攻击，通过精心设计的触发提示诱导模型产生冗余推理过程，显著增加计算成本，同时保持最终输出的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着思维链提示技术提升大型语言模型的推理能力，其计算效率成为新的攻击面。本文旨在揭示推理效率可被隐蔽操纵的关键漏洞。

Method: 通过基于中毒的微调策略实现攻击，采用基于LLM的迭代优化过程生成高度自然的污染数据来嵌入该行为。

Result: 在多个最先进模型和推理任务上的实验表明，BadThink能持续增加推理轨迹长度——在MATH-500数据集上实现超过17倍的增长——同时保持隐蔽性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了一个关键且先前未被探索的漏洞，即推理效率可被隐蔽操纵，展示了对CoT赋能系统的新型复杂攻击类别。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but have also introduced their computational efficiency as a new attack surface. In this paper, we propose BadThink, the first backdoor attack designed to deliberately induce "overthinking" behavior in CoT-enabled LLMs while ensuring stealth. When activated by carefully crafted trigger prompts, BadThink manipulates the model to generate inflated reasoning traces - producing unnecessarily redundant thought processes while preserving the consistency of final outputs. This subtle attack vector creates a covert form of performance degradation that significantly increases computational costs and inference time while remaining difficult to detect through conventional output evaluation methods. We implement this attack through a sophisticated poisoning-based fine-tuning strategy, employing a novel LLM-based iterative optimization process to embed the behavior by generating highly naturalistic poisoned data. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art models and reasoning tasks show that BadThink consistently increases reasoning trace lengths - achieving an over 17x increase on the MATH-500 dataset - while remaining stealthy and robust. This work reveals a critical, previously unexplored vulnerability where reasoning efficiency can be covertly manipulated, demonstrating a new class of sophisticated attacks against CoT-enabled systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PISanitizer是一种针对长上下文LLM的提示注入防御方法，通过识别和清理潜在注入令牌来消除注入指令的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示注入防御方法主要针对短上下文设计，在长上下文场景下效果有限，因为注入指令只占长上下文的很小部分，防御难度大。

Method: 基于两个观察：1）提示注入攻击本质是构造强制LLM遵循的指令；2）LLM利用注意力机制关注关键输入令牌。PISanitizer故意让LLM遵循上下文中的任意指令，然后清理驱动指令遵循行为的高注意力令牌。

Result: 广泛评估表明PISanitizer能成功防止提示注入，保持实用性，优于现有防御方法，效率高，且对基于优化的强自适应攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PISanitizer为攻击者制造了一个困境：注入指令越有效强制LLM遵循，就越可能被PISanitizer清理掉。

Abstract: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/sleeepeer/PISanitizer.

Conclusion: 可行性感知的定向模糊测试能显著提高测试效率，AFLGopher在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Directed fuzzing is a useful testing technique that aims to efficiently reach target code sites in a program. The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \emph{feasibility-unaware}.
  In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision. We implemented AFLGopher and compared AFLGopher with state-of-the-art directed fuzzers including AFLGo, enhanced AFLGo, WindRanger, BEACON and SelectFuzz. AFLGopher is 3.76x, 2.57x, 3.30x, 2.52x and 2.86x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in reaching targets. AFLGopher is 5.60x, 5.20x, 4.98x, 4.52x, and 5.07x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in triggering known vulnerabilities.

Result: Armadillo能在3轮通信内完成安全聚合，同时保持服务器和客户端的计算轻量级。

Conclusion: Armadillo提供了一个高效且具有抗干扰能力的安全聚合解决方案，显著优于现有方案的计算和通信效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a secure aggregation system Armadillo that has disruptive resistance against adversarial clients, such that any coalition of malicious clients (within the tolerated threshold) can affect the aggregation result only by misreporting their private inputs in a pre-defined legitimate range. Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking embeds hidden information in images such that the watermark can survive various manipulations. However, the emergence of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of diffusion-based image editing and robust image watermarking. We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Finally, we discuss ethical implications of such watermark removal capablities and provide design guidelines for future watermarking strategies to be more resilient in the era of generative AI.

*Jeuk Kang,Jungheum Park*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GYNOPTICON是一个基于用户共识的作弊检测框架，通过客户端轻量级检测和服务器端投票系统来识别作弊行为，为竞争性在线游戏提供隐私保护的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性游戏类型（如MOBA、FPS、RTS）中的作弊检测研究不足，现有内核级反作弊方案存在隐私和安全风险，需要开发更透明、隐私友好的解决方案。

Method: 结合客户端轻量级检测机制和服务器端投票系统：客户端检测可疑活动后向服务器投票，服务器聚合投票建立共识来区分作弊者和合法玩家。

Result: 在受控模拟和真实FPS环境中验证了可行性，模拟结果确认系统要求，真实实验证明能可靠检测作弊用户，公开数据集验证了长期适用性。

Conclusion: GYNOPTICON提供了一种用户驱动、基于共识的替代方案，相比传统反作弊系统更透明、减少侵入性监控、降低隐私风险，适用于竞争性在线游戏的长期管理。

Abstract: Cheating in online games poses significant threats to the gaming industry, yet most prior research has concentrated on Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). Competitive genres-such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), First Person Shooter (FPS), Real Time Strategy (RTS), and Action games-remain underexplored due to the difficulty of detecting cheating users and the demand for complex data and techniques. To address this gap, many game companies rely on kernel-level anti-cheat solutions, which, while effective, raise serious concerns regarding user privacy and system security. In this paper, we propose GYNOPTICON, a novel cheating detection framework that leverages user consensus to identify abnormal behavior. GYNOPTICON integrates a lightweight client-side detection mechanism with a server-side voting system: when suspicious activity is identified, clients cast votes to the server, which aggregates them to establish consensus and distinguish cheaters from legitimate players. This architecture enables transparency, reduces reliance on intrusive monitoring, and mitigates privacy risks. We evaluate GYNOPTICON in both a controlled simulation and a real-world FPS environment. Simulation results verify its feasibility and requirements, while real-world experiments confirm its effectiveness in reliably detecting cheating users. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's applicability and sustainability for long-term game management using public datasets. GYNOPTICON represents a user-driven, consensus-based alternative to conventional anti-cheat systems, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for competitive online games.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SALT-V是一个混合认证框架，通过协议分层解决V2X通信中的认证困境，结合ECDSA签名和轻量级GMAC操作，在保证安全性的同时实现微秒级验证延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决V2X通信中传统公钥方案验证延迟过长（2ms）与对称方案密钥披露延迟过高（20-100ms）的矛盾，满足5G NR-V2X对即时认证和计算效率的严格要求。

Method: 采用智能协议分层：10%流量使用ECDSA签名建立信任锚点，90%流量使用轻量级GMAC操作；核心创新包括临时会话标签白名单机制和Bloom过滤器集成。

Result: 平均计算时间0.035ms（比纯ECDSA快57倍），端到端延迟1ms，开销41字节，可线性扩展到2000辆车，满足实时V2X部署的所有安全关键要求。

Conclusion: SALT-V是首个满足V2X实时部署所有关键要求的实用解决方案，成功调和了安全性与效率之间的基本权衡。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication faces a critical authentication dilemma: traditional public-key schemes like ECDSA provide strong security but impose 2 ms verification delays unsuitable for collision avoidance, while symmetric approaches like TESLA achieve microsecond-level efficiency at the cost of 20-100 ms key disclosure latency. Neither meets 5G New Radio (NR)-V2X's stringent requirements for both immediate authentication and computational efficiency. This paper presents SALT-V, a novel hybrid authentication framework that reconciles this fundamental trade-off through intelligent protocol stratification. SALT-V employs ECDSA signatures for 10% of traffic (BOOT frames) to establish sender trust, then leverages this trust anchor to authenticate 90% of messages (DATA frames) using lightweight GMAC operations. The core innovation - an Ephemeral Session Tag (EST) whitelist mechanism - enables 95% of messages to achieve immediate verification without waiting for key disclosure, while Bloom filter integration provides O(1) revocation checking in 1 us. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SALT-V achieves 0.035 ms average computation time (57x faster than pure ECDSA), 1 ms end-to-end latency, 41-byte overhead, and linear scalability to 2000 vehicles, making it the first practical solution to satisfy all safety-critical requirements for real-time V2X deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了联邦归一化方法，通过安全交换归一化参数来模拟集中式归一化的效果，同时保护数据隐私，解决了联邦学习中数据归一化的挑战。


<details>

Result: 联邦归一化方法在异构联邦学习场景下能够达到与集中归一化相当的性能，同时不损害数据本地性。通过隐私保护方案有效降低了共享归一化参数带来的隐私风险。

Conclusion: 联邦归一化是联邦学习中数据预处理的有效解决方案，通过安全参数交换平衡了性能与隐私保护需求，为联邦学习中的标准化处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data normalization is a crucial preprocessing step for enhancing model performance and training stability. In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parties, i.e., pooled normalization. Local normalization can be problematic when data distributions across parties are non-IID, while the pooled normalization approach conflicts with the decentralized nature of FL. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of widely used normalization techniques to FL and define the term federated normalization. Federated normalization simulates pooled normalization by enabling the collaborative exchange of normalization parameters among parties. Thus, it achieves performance on par with pooled normalization without compromising data locality. However, sharing normalization parameters such as the mean introduces potential privacy risks, which we further mitigate through a robust privacy-preserving solution. Our contributions include: (i) We systematically evaluate the impact of various federated and local normalization techniques in heterogeneous FL scenarios, (ii) We propose a novel homomorphically encrypted $k$-th ranked element (and median) calculation tailored for the federated setting, enabling secure and efficient federated normalization, (iii) We propose privacy-preserving implementations of widely used normalization techniques for FL, leveraging multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MHE).

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在检测非EVM区块链平台（Solana和Algorand）智能合约中OWASP漏洞的能力，通过构建合成数据集并比较不同配置下LLM的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约在去中心化环境中发挥关键作用，但代码设计不当会带来风险。现有研究主要关注EVM生态系统，缺乏对非EVM平台漏洞检测的研究，且缺少标注数据集。

Method: 构建了基于Rust（Solana）和PyTeal（Algorand）的合成标注数据集，采用OWASP漏洞分类法。评估了三种LLM配置：提示工程、微调以及两者的混合方法。

Result: 提示工程具有通用鲁棒性，微调在语义较贫乏的语言（如TEAL）上提高了精确率和召回率。分析了Solana和Algorand架构差异对漏洞表现和可检测性的影响。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的方法在智能合约静态漏洞检测中具有可行性，前提是将领域特定数据和分类整合到训练流程中。

Abstract: Smart contracts have emerged as key components within decentralized environments, enabling the automation of transactions through self-executing programs. While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling. Our findings suggest that LLM-based approaches are viable for static vulnerability detection in smart contracts, provided domain-specific data and categorization are integrated into training pipelines.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SEAL是一个子空间锚定水印框架，通过将多比特签名嵌入到模型的潜在表示空间中，为LLMs提供强大的知识产权保护，支持白盒和黑盒验证，并保持高保真度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为高价值知识产权资产需要强大的保护机制，但现有方法如模型指纹识别无法保护具体模型实例，传统后门水印方法容易被微调或知识蒸馏等后处理操作移除。

Method: 利用模型编辑技术将选定锚点样本的隐藏表示与预定义的正交比特向量对齐，在模型的潜在表示空间中嵌入水印，同时保持模型的原始事实预测能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和六个主要LLMs上的实验表明，SEAL在有效性、保真度、效率和鲁棒性方面优于11种现有指纹识别和水印方法，即使在对手了解水印机制和嵌入签名的情况下仍保持强大的验证性能。

Conclusion: SEAL框架为LLMs提供了一种功能无害、隐蔽且鲁棒的水印保护方案，能够有效保护模型知识产权，抵抗各种攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, demonstrating human-level performance in text generation, reasoning, and question answering. However, training such models requires substantial computational resources, large curated datasets, and sophisticated alignment procedures. As a result, they constitute highly valuable intellectual property (IP) assets that warrant robust protection mechanisms. Existing IP protection approaches suffer from critical limitations. Model fingerprinting techniques can identify model architectures but fail to establish ownership of specific model instances. In contrast, traditional backdoor-based watermarking methods embed behavioral anomalies that can be easily removed through common post-processing operations such as fine-tuning or knowledge distillation.
  We propose SEAL, a subspace-anchored watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit signatures directly into the model's latent representational space, supporting both white-box and black-box verification scenarios. Our approach leverages model editing techniques to align the hidden representations of selected anchor samples with predefined orthogonal bit vectors. This alignment embeds the watermark while preserving the model's original factual predictions, rendering the watermark functionally harmless and stealthy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and six prominent LLMs, comparing SEAL with 11 existing fingerprinting and watermarking methods to demonstrate its superior effectiveness, fidelity, efficiency, and robustness. Furthermore, we evaluate SEAL under potential knowledgeable attacks and show that it maintains strong verification performance even when adversaries possess knowledge of the watermarking mechanism and the embedded signatures.

Motivation: Wi-Fi CSI作为生物识别方式被广泛研究，但缺乏对其安全属性、对抗性恢复能力和方法一致性的系统理解，需要从安全角度进行系统化知识梳理。

Method: 通过系统化知识方法，分析现有工作在传感基础设施、信号表示、特征管道、学习模型和评估方法等方面的差异，构建统一评估框架并使用安全相关指标进行实证分析。

Result: 发现系统性不一致：依赖聚合准确度指标、有限报告FAR/FRR/EER、缺乏每用户风险分析、很少考虑威胁模型或对抗可行性。实证显示传统报告实践隐藏了风险集中问题。

Conclusion: 阐明了当前CSI生物识别的安全边界，为严格评估、可重复实验和未来研究提供了指导方针，为安全社区提供了对Wi-Fi CSI生物识别作为认证原语适用性的结构化重新评估。

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.

Motivation: 分析大型闭源应用WhatsApp的安全实现，识别功能漏洞和侧信道攻击风险，弥补规范与实现之间的差距。

Method: 结合CryptoBap二进制分析和Ghidra逆向工程提取协议模型，扩展CryptoBap集成硬件泄漏合约，使用DeepSec协议验证器进行安全分析。

Result: 证明了前向保密性，识别了克隆攻击，发现规范与实现的功能差距，确认了电子护照BAC协议的非链接性攻击，并识别了允许攻击者获取受害者联系人的隐私攻击。

Conclusion: 成功构建了首个WhatsApp形式化模型，开发了集成侧信道分析的框架，揭示了基于规范方法无法发现的严重漏洞。

Abstract: We extract the first formal model of WhatsApp from its implementation by combining binary-level analysis (via CryptoBap) with reverse engineering (via Ghidra) to handle this large closed-source application. Using this model, we prove forward secrecy, identify a known clone-attack against post-compromise security and discover functional gaps between WhatsApp's implementation and its specification. We further introduce a methodology to analyze cryptographic protocol implementations for their resilience to side-channel attacks. This is achieved by extending the CryptoBap framework to integrate hardware leakage contracts into the protocol model, which we then pass to the state-of-the-art protocol prover, DeepSec. This enables a detailed security analysis against both functional bugs and microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Using this methodology, we identify a privacy attack in WhatsApp that allows a side-channel attacker to learn the victim's contacts and confirm a known unlinkability attack on the BAC protocol used in electronic passports.
  Key contributions include (1) the first formal model of WhatsApp, extracted from its binary, (2) a framework to integrate side-channel leakage contracts into protocol models for the first time, and (3) revealing critical vulnerabilities invisible to specification-based methods.

*Shreya Meel,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异构分布式属性基私有访问控制（HetDAPAC）框架，通过将非敏感属性验证集中化处理，在保持敏感属性隐私的同时提高了系统速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DAPAC系统对所有属性采用相同的隐私保护级别，但并非所有属性都是敏感的，这种统一的隐私约束会降低系统速率。为了利用用户属性的异构隐私需求，需要设计更灵活的隐私保护方案。

Method: 提出HetDAPAC框架，将N个属性中的N-D个非敏感属性验证卸载到中央服务器，仅对D个敏感属性保留DAPAC的分布式架构。设计了两种方案：一种提高速率但下载不均衡，另一种实现均衡下载。

Result: 第一种方案将速率从1/2K提高到1/(K+1)，但存在服务器间下载不均衡问题；第二种方案实现均衡下载，速率为(D+1)/(2KD)。

Conclusion: HetDAPAC框架通过区分敏感和非敏感属性，在保持敏感属性隐私的同时显著提高了系统速率，为属性基访问控制提供了更实用的隐私-效率权衡方案。

Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.

Motivation: 战略能力模型检查是一个极其困难的问题，尤其是在具有不完美信息的智能体在随机环境中行动的现实情况下。假设-保证推理可以通过将复杂问题分解为一系列更简单的子问题来提供帮助。

Method: 提出了几种用于概率交替时序逻辑与不完美信息的假设-保证验证方案，并引入了一种新的非概率交替逻辑变体，其中战略模态捕获"最多实现φ"的概念。

Result: 证明了所提出方案的正确性，并讨论了它们的完备性。

Abstract: Model checking of strategic abilities is a notoriously hard problem, even more so in the realistic case of agents with imperfect information, acting in a stochastic environment. Assume-guarantee reasoning can be of great help here, providing a way to decompose the complex problem into a small set of easier subproblems.
  In this paper, we propose several schemes for assume-guarantee verification of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. We prove the soundness of the schemes, and discuss their completeness. On the way, we also propose a new variant of (non-probabilistic) alternating-time logic, where the strategic modalities capture "achieving at most $\varphi$," analogous to Levesque's logic of "only knowing."

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统中LLM的训练方法缺乏将系统级评估与智能体级和消息级学习连接起来的原理性方法，需要建立统一的评估到监督的转化机制。

Method: 结合合作博弈论归因（如Shapley值）与过程奖励建模，在成功案例中基于Shapley的信用分配公平分配结果并细化为每消息奖励；在失败案例中通过首次错误定位产生修复感知偏好。

Result: 产生了局部、有符号且信用保守的信号，这些信号有界、合作且直接兼容基于强化或偏好的后训练，提供了从全局评估到局部监督的可审计路径。

Conclusion: 提出了一个理论框架和训练信号，为LLM多智能体训练提供了从系统评估到局部监督的统一方法，但实证验证留待未来工作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.

Conclusion: 多智能体系统需要安全感知的设计方法，SafeAgents框架为MAS安全评估提供了系统化工具，揭示了设计选择对安全性的重要影响。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.
